# ClangASTPrinter
A JSON AST printer for Clang 

This was copied from facebook clang plugins. I was tired it refused to compile. This works with clang release 4.0.0 from www.llvm.org

Use the script 

    build_clang_linux.sh 4.0.0 <your-build-dir>

to automatically fetch, arrange and build a valid clang tree
